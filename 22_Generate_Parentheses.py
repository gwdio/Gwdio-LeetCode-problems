The goal is to generate all compositions of natural numbers that sum to n
To do this, we will use the following algorithm:
for any n, generate all n-1 possible pair decompositions and the identity, and save them
the identity actually doesn't need to be saved because it was saved in the run prior 
(except for base case)
ie: 5 -> 5 14 23 32 41
for all pairs, generate all possible pair decompositions of the first number
ie:
14 -> 14
23 -> 113, 23
32 -> 122, 212, 32
41 -> 131, 221, 311, 41
repeat until first digit is 1

proof: PSMI
base case: n=1
The only ordering of 1 that can be produces is (1), which is produced by the algorithm

inductive hypothesis: Assume that for all k<n, algo generates all k compositions correctly. 
Prove that algo generates all n factors correctly

1. Algo produces the following values
identity, 1+(n-1), 2+(n-2), 3+(n-3), ... (n-1)+1

2. Therefore, by the induction hypothesis, algo produces all compositions k for k<n, 
with the remainder amount appended to the end, along with identity

3. Given that all compositions produces are shifted to n, all compositions are valid. Additionally,
there are no collisions as the net sum of all prior elements is not enough to generate a further solution
and the end values are never touched, so an amount os sum never used is locked away there

4. The algorithm generates all the end-compositions, but what about other intermediate compositions?
using the induction hypothesis again, it is clear that any intermediate composition will be represented in
the set of compositions of the n-"end term", so all intermediate compositions are covered.

5. Therefore, by PSMI, all compositions are covered by this algorithm
